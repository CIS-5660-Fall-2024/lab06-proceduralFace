Note: I added some params to `faceSDF` - pass in a rest face, a modulated face, and an interp parameter. In `sceneSDF` I create a rest face and a couple modulated faces (surprise face, snarl face). The quality of my animations isn't superb, I focused more on making the creation of new faces as extensible and easy as possible.
